# LSM in a Week

[![CI (main)](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Build a simple key-value storage engine in a week! And extend your LSM engine on the second + third week.

## [Tutorial](https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm)

The Mini-LSM book is available at [https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm](https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm).

## Development

```
cargo x install-tools
cargo x check
cargo x book
```

If you changed public API in the reference solution, you might also need to synchronize it to the starter crate.
To do this, use `cargo x sync`.

## Structure

* mini-lsm: the final solution code for <= week 2
* mini-lsm-mvcc: the final solution code for week 3 MVCC
* mini-lsm-starter: the starter code
* mini-lsm-book: the tutorial

We have another repo mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint at [https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint). In this repo, each commit corresponds to a chapter in the tutorial. We will not update the solution checkpoint very often.

## Demo

You can run the reference solution by yourself to gain an overview of the system before you start.

```
cargo run --bin mini-lsm-cli-ref
cargo run --bin mini-lsm-cli-mvcc-ref
```

And we have a compaction simulator to experiment with your compaction algorithm implementation,

```
cargo run --bin compaction-simulator-ref
cargo run --bin compaction-simulator-mvcc-ref
```

## Progress

We are working on chapter 3 and more test cases for all existing contents.

* Week 1: Storage Format + Engine Skeleton
* Week 2: Compaction and Persistence
* Week 3: Multi-Version Concurrency Control
* The Extra Week / Rest of Your Life: Optimizations  (unlikely to be available in 2024...)
