# Read Path

![Chapter Overview](./lsm-tutorial/week1-05-overview.svg)

In this chapter, you will:

* Integrate SST into the LSM read path.
* Implement LSM read path `get` with SSTs.
* Implement LSM read path `scan` with SSTs.

## Task 1: Two Merge Iterator

## Task 2: Read Path - Get

## Task 3: Read Path - Scan

## Test Your Understanding

* Consider the case that a user has an iterator that iterates the whole storage engine, and the storage engine is 1TB large, so that it takes ~1 hour to scan all the data. What would be the problems if the user does so? (This is a good question and we will ask it several times at different points of the tutorial...)

We do not provide reference answers to the questions, and feel free to discuss about them in the Discord community.
