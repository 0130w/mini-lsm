# Snapshot Isolation and Serializable Snapshot Isolation

## Task 1: Snapshot Isolation: Detect Write-Write Conflict

## Task 2: Serializable: Record Read Set and Write Set

## Task 3: Serializable Verification

## Test Your Understanding

* If you have some experience with building a relational database, you may think about the following question: assume that we build a database based on Mini-LSM where we store each row in the relation table as a key-value pair and enable serializable verification, does the database system directly get ANSI serializable isolation level capability? Why or why not?
