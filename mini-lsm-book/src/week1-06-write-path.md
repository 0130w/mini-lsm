# Write Path

![Chapter Overview](./lsm-tutorial/week1-05-overview.svg)

In this chapter, you will:

* Implement the LSM write path with L0 flush.
* Implement the logic to correctly update the LSM state.


To copy the test cases into the starter code and run them,

```
cargo x copy-test --week 1 --day 6
cargo x scheck
```

## Task 1: Flush Memtable to SST

## Task 2: Update the LSM State

## Task 3: Filter the SSTs

## Test Your Understanding

* What happens if a user requests to delete a key twice?

We do not provide reference answers to the questions, and feel free to discuss about them in the Discord community.
