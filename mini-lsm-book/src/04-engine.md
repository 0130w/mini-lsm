# Storage Engine and Block Cache


<!-- toc -->

In this part, you will need to modify:

* `src/lsm_iterator.rs`
* `src/lsm_storage.rs`
* Other parts that use `SsTable::read_block`

You can use `cargo x copy-test day4` to copy our provided test cases to the starter code directory. After you have
finished this part, use `cargo x scheck` to check the style and run all test cases. If you want to write your own
test cases, write a new module `#[cfg(test)] mod user_tests { /* your test cases */ }` in `table.rs`. Remember to remove
`#![allow(...)]` at the top of the modules you modified so that cargo clippy can actually check the styles.

## Task 1 - Put and Delete
